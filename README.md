## Home Assignment: Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Tool Using LangChain and ChatOllama

**Objective:**  
Develop a basic application that uses the CoinGecko API to fetch real-time cryptocurrency data and employs LangChain integrated with ChatOllama to predict future price trends and provide insights.

**Assignment Details:**

1. **API Integration and Data Fetching:**
   - Use the CoinGecko API to fetch current price data for a selected cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum). CoinGecko API is a free and public API that provides real-time and historical data on cryptocurrencies. [CoinGecko API documentation](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation).

2. **LangChain and ChatOllama Integration:**
   - Implement LangChain to manage the workflow between fetching the data and processing it through ChatOllama. The application should take the real-time price data, send it to ChatOllama, and generate predictions or insights such as "The price trend suggests a possible increase in the next few hours due to market volatility."

3. **Application Logic:**
   - Set up the LangChain logic to automate the process of data retrieval, query generation for ChatOllama, receiving the response, and presenting it to the user.

4. **User Interface:** [Optional]
   - Develop a straightforward interface where users can select a cryptocurrency, view its current price, and read the insights generated by ChatOllama. This could be a basic web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  
5. **Documentation and Setup:**
   - Provide clear instructions in a README file on setting up the project, including how to install any dependencies, configure API keys, and run the application.

**Submission Requirements:**
- Source code submitted through a GitHub repository.
- A README file with complete setup instructions and a brief overview of the application's functionality.
- Clearly documented code explaining the integration of CoinGecko API, LangChain, and ChatOllama.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Functionality: Does the application successfully fetch data, process it, and display results?
- Code Quality: Is the code well-structured, readable, and commented?
- Innovation and Insight: Quality of insights generated and their relevance to real-world applications.
